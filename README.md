## üéØ How to run?
```
1. The data1 and data2 folders store the association networks, disease and metabolite networks, and initial characterization data for datasets 1 and 2, respectively.
2. The code folder for implementing the RGCGT model, which specifically includes:
  (1) train.py is used to start the RGCGT model and set up parameters, implement training and validation, loss function definition, optimizer selection and parameter update.
  (2) model.py is used to build the overall structure of the RGCGT model, including residual graph convolution (RGC), graph transformer (GT) with multi-hop neighbor aggregation and decoder.
  (3) layers.py mainly stores some customized network layers, including multi-head self-attention layer and feed-forward network, etc.
  (4) utils.py mainly realizes data loading, evaluation index calculation and plot, etc.
3. The results folder stores detailed experimental results on datasets 1 and 2 using jupyter notebook.
